# Smart-Assistive-Stick-for-the-Visually-Impaired

For the completion of this project hardware components: Water sensor, IR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, GPS module, GSM module, Camera Module, buzzer, speaker and Arduino were used. 

A dataset was obtained by copying all relevant images from Google images, cleaning it, preprocessing it and subsequently making a csv file out of it. 

water sensor takes care of puddles and spillage detection, ensuring fewer accidents caused by falling because of slippery floors.

IR sensors are good for depth sensing, ensuring the person is aware for a depressed region and doesnt lose his balance.

Ultrasonic sensor works well to ensure close to mid range obstacle detection.

Camera module can be used to detect important signs like No Entry or Slppery Floor or Caution sign to reduce "inevitable" accidents.
(Image detection is performed using a CNN architecture)

Buzzer and Speakers are means to serve as indicators to intimate the visually impaired person.
